## PROMPT_TEXT

Generate comprehensive task list for extending the Physical AI book with 4 new chapters covering ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and language-action integration.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks.md file with 100 detailed tasks organized across 7 phases. Tasks are organized by user stories (chapters) with proper checklist format, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities. The tasks cover all required content areas: Chapter 2 (ROS 2), Chapter 3 (Simulation), Chapter 4 (AI Perception), and Chapter 5 (VLA). Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy follows MVP-first approach starting with Chapter 2.

## OUTCOME

Complete task breakdown for the Physical AI book extension with 100 specific, actionable tasks organized by chapter/user story with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities.
