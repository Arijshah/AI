# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI book! This comprehensive guide will teach you about embodied intelligence through simple, hands-on lessons.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and physical systems, enabling machines to interact intelligently with the real world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI encompasses robotics, embodied intelligence, and systems that perceive, reason, and act in physical environments.

## About This Book

This book is designed to be:
- **Beginner-friendly**: Starting from fundamental concepts
- **Practical**: With hands-on exercises and code examples
- **Minimal theory**: Focusing on practical applications
