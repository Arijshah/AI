# Physical AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Learning Flow
Every concept is introduced with a practical, step-by-step learning flow, ensuring accessibility for beginners and clear progression for intermediate learners.

### II. Technology Stack
The book will be built using Docusaurus, leveraging its capabilities for documentation, search, and versioning to provide a robust and user-friendly reading experience.

### III. Content Focus
The primary goal is to teach beginners and intermediate learners the fundamentals of embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics through clear explanations and hands-on examples.

### IV. Success Metrics
The project is considered successful when the book is published to GitHub Pages and includes a working RAG chatbot that answers questions based solely on the book's content.

### V. Brand Voice
All content and interactions will maintain a simple, supportive, and beginner-friendly brand voice to encourage and empower learners.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance.
